Below are the results from the ANOVA simulation app. 

**Study Design**

`r paste(params$design)`

**Model Formula** 

`r paste(params$model)`

The sample size was `r params$n` per cell with the following adjustment for multiple comparisons: `r params$padjust`. 

A plot of the study design is below.


```{r echo = FALSE}
# The `params` object is available in the document.
params$means_plot
```

The study has the following power for the main effects and interaction

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(params$tableMain)

params$pvalue_plot
```

Further, the power for multiple comparisons are included below

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(params$tablePC)
```
