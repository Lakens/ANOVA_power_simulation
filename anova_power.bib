  abstract = {Designing Experiments and Analyzing Data: A Model Comparison Perspective (3rd edition) offers an integrative conceptual framework for understanding experimental design and data analysis. Maxwell, Delaney, and Kelley first apply fundamental principles to simple experimental designs followed by an application of the same principles to more complicated designs. Their integrative conceptual framework better prepares readers to understand the logic behind a general strategy of data analysis that is appropriate for a wide variety of designs, which allows for the introduction of more complex topics that are generally omitted from other books. Numerous pedagogical features further facilitate understanding: examples of published research demonstrate the applicability of each chapter's content; flowcharts assist in choosing the most appropriate procedure; end-of-chapter lists of important formulas highlight key ideas and assist readers in locating the initial presentation of equations; useful programming code and tips are provided throughout the book and in associated resources available online, and extensive sets of exercises help develop a deeper understanding of the subject. Detailed solutions for some of the exercises and realistic data sets are included on the website (DesigningExperiments.com). The pedagogical approach used throughout the book enables readers to gain an overview of experimental design, from conceptualization of the research question to analysis of the data. The book and its companion website with web apps, tutorials, and detailed code are ideal for students and researchers seeking the optimal way to design their studies and analyze the resulting data.},

  abstract = {Experimental designs involving repeated measures may be analyzed using traditional ANOVA methods (if all assumptions are met), or, given sufficientsample size, with a MANOVA-type procedure (if only some assumptions are met). Recent statistical advances have made possible the extension of these procedures to repeated measures experimental designs involving multiple dependent variables. This tutorialpresents the concepts, complete examples (including computer control commands), and interpretations for four methods of testingdifferences among means in a mixed modelrepeated measures design. The four methods of analysis are: The traditional ANOVA and the MANOVA method for the single dependent variable case, and a Multivariate Mixed Model analysis and a Doubly Multivariate analysis for the multipledependent variable case.},

  title = {Statistical Power for the Two-Factor Repeated Measures {{ANOVA}}},
  volume = {32},
  issn = {1532-5970},
  doi = {10/fqbpn7},
  abstract = {Determining a priori power for univariate repeated measures (RM) ANOVA designs with two or more within-subjects factors that have different correlational patterns between the factors is currently difficult due to the unavailability of accurate methods to estimate the error variances used in power calculations. The main objective of this study was to determine the effect of the correlation between the levels in one RM factor on the power of the other RM factor. Monte Carlo simulation procedures were used to estimate power for the A, B, and AB tests of a 2\texttimes{}3, a 2\texttimes{}6, a 2\texttimes{}9, a 3\texttimes{}3, a 3\texttimes{}6, and a 3\texttimes{}9 design under varying experimental conditions of effect size (small, medium, and large), average correlation (.4 and .8), alpha (.01 and .05), and sample size (n = 5, 10 ,15, 20, 25, and 30). Results indicated that the greater the magnitude of the differences between the average correlation among the levels of Factor A and the average correlation in the AB matrix, the lower the power for Factor B (and vice versa). Equations for estimating the error variance of each test of the two-way model were constructed by examining power and mean square error trends across different correlation matrices. Support for the accuracy of these formulae is given, thus allowing for direct analytic power calculations in future studies.},

The book provides a guide to conducting analyses that is appropriate for researchers and students, including those with limited quantitative backgrounds. With practical use in mind, the text provides detailed coverage of topics such as how to estimate expected effect sizes and power analyses for complex designs. The topical coverage of the text, an applied approach, in-depth coverage of popular statistical procedures, and a focus on conducting analyses using R make the text a unique contribution to the power literature. To facilitate application and usability, the text includes ready-to-use R code developed for the text. An accompanying R package called pwr2ppl (available at https://github.com/chrisaberson/pwr2ppl) provides tools for conducting power analyses across each topic covered in the text.},
