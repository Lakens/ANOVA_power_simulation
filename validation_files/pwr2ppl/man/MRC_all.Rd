\title{Compute power for Mutliple Regression with Three Predictors
Requires correlations between all variables as sample size. Means, sds, and alpha are option. Also computes Power(All)}

  s3 = 1)
}

\item{ry2}{Correlation between DV (y) and second predictor (2)}

\item{ry3}{Correlation between DV (y) and third predictor (3)}

\item{r12}{Correlation between first (1) and second predictor (2)}

\item{r13}{Correlation between first (1) and third predictor (3)}

\item{n}{Sample size}

\item{alpha}{Type I error (default is .05)}

\item{rep}{number of replications (default is 10000)}
}
