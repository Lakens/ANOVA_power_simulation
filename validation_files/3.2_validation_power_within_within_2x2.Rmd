## Validation of Power in Mixed ANOVA

We install the functions:

```{r}
# Install the two functions from GitHub by running the code below:

```

## Two by two ANOVA, within-between design

We can simulate a 2x2 ANOVA, both factors manipulated within participants, with a specific sample size and effect size, to achieve a desired statistical power.

As Potvin & Schutz (2000) explain, analytic procedures for a two-factor repeated measures ANOVA do not seem to exist. The main problem is quantifying the error variance (the denominator when calculating lambda or Cohen's f).

For the 2-way interaction, the result should be a power of 91.25% is we have a total samplesize of 46. Since we have 2 groups in the between factor that means the sample size per group is 2 (and both these groups collect 2 repeated measures). 

```{r}
mu <- c(-0.25, 0.25, 0.25, -0.25)
n <- 23
sd <- 1
r <- 0.5
string = "2w*2b"
alpha_level <- 0.05
p_adjust = "none"
labelnames = c("age", "old", "young", "color", "blue", "red")
design_result <- ANOVA_design(string = string,
                              n = n, 
                              mu = mu, 
                              sd = sd, 
                              r = r, 
                              p_adjust = p_adjust,
                              labelnames = labelnames)


simulation_result <- ANOVA_power(design_result, alpha = 0.05, nsims = nsims)

```

## Two by two ANOVA, within-between design Variation 1

We can simulate the same Two-Way ANOVA increasing the correlation to 0.7.

```{r}
mu <- c(-0.25, 0.25, 0.25, -0.25)
n <- 23
sd <- 1
r <- 0.7
string = "2w*2b"
alpha_level <- 0.05
p_adjust = "none"
labelnames = c("age", "old", "young", "color", "blue", "red")
design_result <- ANOVA_design(string = string,
                              n = n, 
                              mu = mu, 
                              sd = sd, 
                              r = r, 
                              p_adjust = p_adjust,
                              labelnames = labelnames)


simulation_result <- ANOVA_power(design_result, alpha = 0.05, nsims = nsims)

```
