Power curves
------------

Power is calculated for a specific value of an effect size, alpha level, and sample size. Because you often do not know the true effect size, it often makes more sense to think of the power curve as a function of the size of the effect. Although power curves can be calculated based on simulations for any design, we will use the analytic solution to calculate the power of ANOVA designs because these calculations are much faster. The basic approach is to calculate power for a specific pattern of means, a specific effect size, a given alpha level, and a specific pattern of correlations. This is one example:

``` r
#2x2 design
mu = c(0,0,0,0.5)
m_A = 2 # 2 levels of factor A
m_B = 2  # 2 levels of factor B
sigma = 1 
n = 20
rho_A = 0.5
rho_B = 0.5
rho_AB = 0.5
alpha = 0.05

power_res <- power_2x2_within(mu = mu, 
                              m_A = m_A, 
                              m_B = m_B, 
                              sigma = sigma, 
                              n = n, 
                              rho_A = rho_A, 
                              rho_B = rho_B, 
                              rho_AB = rho_AB, 
                              alpha = alpha)

power_res$pow_A
```

    ## [1] 0.3235926

``` r
power_res$pow_B
```

    ## [1] 0.3235926

``` r
power_res$pow_AB
```

    ## [1] 0.5645044

We can make these calculations for a range of sample sizes, to get a power curve. We created a simple function that performs these calculations across a range of sample sizes (from n = 2 to max\_, a variable you can specify in the function).

``` r
p_a <- plot_power_2x2_within(mu = c(0,0,0,0.5), 
                      m_A = 2, 
                      m_B = 2, 
                      sigma = 1, 
                      rho_A = 0.5, 
                      rho_B = 0.5, 
                      rho_AB = 0.5, 
                      alpha = 0.05,
                      max_n <- 50)

grid.arrange(p_a$p1, p_a$p2, p_a$p3, nrow = 1)
```
